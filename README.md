## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a hidden, productive oyster bed on 'enclosed' Company land. Do they keep it secret, or share it?
- Create a monologue for Edwin Bayliss justifying the Company's actions as 'progress' and 'economic necessity.'
- Draft a letter from Martha to a sympathetic journalist in London, describing the conditions on the flats.
- Imagine a conversation between the women dredgers, planning a collective action that isn't a traditional strike.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the Leigh estuary, showing the historical 'common' beds vs. the Company's enclosed licenses, with character viewpoints pinned to locations.
- Create a 'Tide & Debt' simulator: a text-based game where the player manages Martha's family, balancing catch yields against the rising tide, rent, and Bayliss's offers.
