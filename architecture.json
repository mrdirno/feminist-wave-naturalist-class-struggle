  "cover_prompt": "A determined young woman in worn, salt-stained work clothes stands defiantly in the shallows, clutching a ledger book to her chest as she stares down a line of advancing men in fine coats, the tension between collective sustenance and private ownership made physical, set against the vast, mist-shrouded estuary of the Thames at dawn with mudflats stretching to a distant, encroaching city. In the atmospheric style of a feminist wave naturalist painting, evoking the detailed social realism of Kathe Kollwitz merged with the luminous, turbulent seascapes of Ivan Aivazovsky, capturing both gritty human struggle and the sublime power of the elemental shore. Book cover framing, centered composition with a low, dramatic angle looking up at the woman, making her a monumental figure against the sweeping sky, the composition divided between the rich, dark mud and the vast, hopeful light. Chiaroscuro lighting with a cool, desaturated palette of slate grey, ochre, and sea-foam green, pierced by a single shaft of wan, golden dawn light illuminating the ledger and her resolute expression. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
